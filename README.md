## Features

### Core
- **Streaming Chat** — Real-time streaming responses from LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible API
- **Conversation History** — Save, rename, delete, and search conversations (SQLite/Prisma)
- **Model Selection** — Pick models loaded in LM Studio, adjust temperature and max tokens
- **Remote Access** — Use Cloudflare Tunnel to access from anywhere with internet
- **Mobile Responsive** — Works on phones and tablets, PWA installable

### Rich Content Rendering
- **LaTeX Math** — Inline (`$E=mc^2$`) and display (`$$...$$`) math rendered via KaTeX (works in both messages and reasoning/thinking fields)
- **Syntax-Highlighted Code** — Fenced code blocks with automatic language detection, GitHub Dark theme, and one-click copy button
- **Reasoning Display** — DeepSeek R1-style `reasoning_content` shown in a collapsible block with full math + code support
- **Document Upload** — Attach PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, or CSV files; text is extracted and sent to the AI as context (10 MB cap, auto-truncates at 50k chars)

### Security & Multi-User
- **Login Authentication** — Scrypt-hashed passwords, JWT sessions (30-day expiry)
- **Per-User Data Isolation** — Every user has their own private conversations, settings, profiles, and MCP servers. No user can access another's data.
- **Per-User Rate Limiting** — Admin can set daily message and/or token limits per user (resets at midnight UTC). Admins are exempt.
- **Login Rate Limiting** — 5 attempts per 15 minutes, automatic lockout on failed logins
- **Security Headers** — X-Frame-Options, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy
- **Password Management** — Change your password from within the app
- **Login Tracking** — Failed and successful login attempts are logged

### Admin Panel
- **User Management** — Create users, delete users, view conversation/message counts
- **Dashboard Stats** — Total users, conversations, messages, logins, messages today, active users today
- **Login Log** — Recent login attempts with IP, username, success/failure status
- **Rate Limit Management** — Set daily message and token limits per user with inline editing and live usage bars
- **Server Control** — Stop the server (Next.js + Hound) directly from the admin panel

### AI Features
- **System Prompts** — Set custom system prompts per conversation (e.g., "Answer in Dutch")
- **Message Editing** — Edit your sent messages and get a fresh AI response
- **Response Regeneration** — Regenerate the last AI response with one click
- **Conversation Branching** — Branch from any message to explore alternative reasoning paths without losing the original conversation
- **MCP Tool Execution** — Full tool-calling loop: when the AI requests a tool, it's executed via MCP and the result is fed back (up to 5 rounds)
- **Web Search (Hound MCP)** — Bundled free local web search with no API keys — search, fetch, crawl, and PDF/OCR
- **Conversation Export** — Download any conversation as a Markdown file

### Context & Usage
- **Token Usage Indicator** — Real-time progress bar showing what percentage of the model's context window is being used (green < 50%, yellow 50-80%, red > 80%)
- **Auto Model Detection** — Fetches available models and context window sizes from LM Studio on startup

### Organization
- **Model Profiles** — Save different LM Studio configurations and switch between them
- **Chat Search** — Full-text search across all your conversations
- **Dark/Light/System Theme** — Manual theme toggle or follow system preference
- **PWA Support** — Install as an app on your phone's home screen

### Deployment
- **One-Command Startup** — `START.bat` (Windows) or `npm run start:all` launches both Next.js and Hound MCP together
- **One-Click Stop** — `STOP.bat` or the admin panel stop button kills both services
- **Docker Support** — One-command deploy with Docker Compose
- **Cross-Platform** — Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Installation

### Option A: Automatic Setup (Windows)

1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Hudson191-max/lm-studio-chat.git
   cd lm-studio-chat
   ```

2. Double-click **`START.bat`** — it does everything automatically:
   - Installs all dependencies (`npm install`)
   - Creates the database (`prisma db push`)
   - Builds the production server (`next build`)
   - Auto-installs Hound MCP if Python is available (`npm run install:hound`)
   - Starts both Next.js + Hound together via the orchestrator

3. Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser and create your account
   - The first account created is automatically the **admin**

### Option B: Manual Setup (Windows / Mac / Linux)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Hudson191-max/lm-studio-chat.git
   cd lm-studio-chat
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create the `.env` file by copying the example:
   ```
   copy .env.example .env        (Windows)
   cp .env.example .env          (Mac/Linux)
   ```
   Then open `.env` and change `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to a random string:
   ```
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   ```
   mkdir db
   npx prisma db push
   ```

5. (Optional) Install Hound MCP for web search:
   ```
   npm run install:hound
   ```
   This requires Python 3.9+. Installs `hound-mcp[all]` + Playwright Chromium.

6. Start everything (Next.js + Hound):
   ```
   npm run build
   npm run start:all
   ```
   Or start only the chat app without Hound:
   ```
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

7. Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser

### Option C: Docker

1. Clone the repo and create `.env`:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Hudson191-max/lm-studio-chat.git
   cd lm-studio-chat
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   ```

2. Build and run:
   ```
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

3. Open **http://localhost:3000** — your data is persisted in a Docker volume

## Stopping the Server

| Method | Command | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Windows** | Double-click `STOP.bat` | Stops Next.js + Hound |
| **CLI (all)** | `npm run stop:all` | Stops Next.js + Hound |
| **CLI** | `npm run stop:next` | Stops only Next.js |
| **CLI** | `npm run stop:hound` | Stops only Hound |
| **Admin Panel** | Click the red Power button | Stops Next.js + Hound from the UI |

---

## Accessing From Anywhere (Cloudflare Tunnel)

1. Download **cloudflared** from https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/
2. Start the chat server first (if not already running)
3. Open a second terminal and run:
   ```
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
   ```
4. Open the `https://xxxx.trycloudflare.com` URL on any device

For a **permanent** URL, create a free Cloudflare account and set up a named tunnel.

---

## Usage

### First Visit
The app detects if no account exists and shows a "Create Account" screen. Pick a username (3+ chars) and password (6+ chars). The **first account created becomes the admin**. After 5 failed login attempts, you'll be locked out for 15 minutes.

### Chatting
- Click **New Chat** in the sidebar to start a conversation
- Use the **System Prompt** bar at the top to set a custom system prompt for the conversation
- Type your message and press **Enter** to send (Shift+Enter for new line)
- Click the **pencil icon** on your messages to edit them
- Click the **refresh icon** on AI responses to regenerate
- Click the **branch icon** (GitBranch) on any message to fork the conversation from that point
- Click the **download icon** to export the conversation as Markdown
- Click the **paperclip/document icon** to attach PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, or CSV files
- Paste or drag-and-drop images for vision models

### Footer Indicators
- **Left:** Number of active MCP tools
- **Right:** Token usage progress bar showing what percentage of the model's context window is used (green/yellow/red), plus "Connected to LM Studio"

### Settings (Sidebar)
- **Search Chats** — Full-text search across all conversations
- **Model Profiles** — Save and switch between different LM Studio configurations
- **MCP Tools** — Connect to MCP servers for tool-using AI (includes one-click Hound preset)
- **Settings** — LM Studio URL, model, temperature, max tokens, theme
- **Change Password** — Update your account password
- **Admin Panel** — (admin only) User management, stats, rate limits, server control
- **Sign Out** — End your session

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
MCP lets you give your AI access to external tools (web search, file system, APIs, etc.):

1. Click **MCP Tools** in the sidebar
2. **Hound preset:** Click "Add to MCP" on the Hound card for instant free web search (auto-detects if Hound is running)
3. **Custom server:** Click "Add Server" and enter the MCP server's URL
4. The app will automatically discover available tools (supports both streamable HTTP and legacy protocols)
5. Toggle servers on/off to enable/disable their tools
6. When the AI calls a tool, it's **executed in real-time** and the result is fed back to the model (up to 5 rounds)
7. You'll see live status: `🔧 Calling tool...` → `⏳ Executing...` → `✅ returned N chars`

### Hound Web Search
[Hound](https://github.com/dondai1234/master-fetch) is a free, keyless MCP server that gives the AI:
- **`smart_search`** — Local web search across 10 backends with neural reranking (no API key needed)
- **`smart_fetch`** — Fetch any URL with anti-bot bypass (Cloudflare, DataDome)
- **`smart_crawl`** — Best-first same-domain crawl
- **`screenshot`** — Capture a page as an image
- **PDF/OCR** — Read scanned PDFs

**Setup:**
```bash
npm run install:hound    # one-time install (requires Python 3.9+)
npm run start:all        # starts Next.js + Hound together
```
Then in the app: MCP Tools → "Add to MCP" on the Hound card.

**Note:** Tool calling requires a model that supports OpenAI-style function calling (e.g. Qwen2.5, Llama 3.1+, Mistral). Enable "Function Calling" in LM Studio's model settings.

### Admin Panel
- **Stats Dashboard** — Users, chats, messages, logins, messages today, active today
- **Users Tab** — Create/delete users, view activity, set daily rate limits (messages + tokens)
- **Login Log Tab** — Recent login attempts with IP and status
- **Server Control** — Red Power button to stop the server

### Conversation Branching
Branch from any message to explore alternative paths:
1. Hover over any message in the chat
2. Click the **branch icon** (GitBranch)
3. A new conversation is created with all messages up to that point copied
4. The new conversation appears in the sidebar with "(branch)" suffix
5. Continue chatting from the fork point — the original conversation is untouched
